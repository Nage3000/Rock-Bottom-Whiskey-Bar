# Rock Bottom Whiskey Bar
 I used a HTML5UP template to create a website for a friend's bar in New Jersey.

 Talked to a good friend, Greg, who heads and runs solo the Rock Bottom Whiskey Bar in New Jersey. We always catch up and talk about our own work. 
 I used to bartend and live with Greg, so I know how difficult it can be to run a bar, do marketing, prep for service, and the last thing on his mind was a website.
 Using my knowledge, and of course a prebuilt template, I was able to within a couple hours put together a simple example of my idea for him. 

What I did find difficult was the vastness of the template, assests on top of assests. And since I've never used SASS before, that added an additional level of difficulty.
Luckily I found some work around by simply editing the HTML where I needed to, changing the images' names to change the content, so I didn't work extensively adjusting many of the pre-made styles within the CSS or JS or SASS. 

This will be an on-going project to define exactly what I can do, and what I still need to learn. But Greg is already happy with the result!
