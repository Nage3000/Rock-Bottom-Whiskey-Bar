# Rock Bottom Whiskey Bar
 I used a HTML5UP template to create a website for a friend's bar in New Jersey.

 Talked to a good friend, Greg, who heads and runs solo the Rock Bottom Whiskey Bar in New Jersey. We always catch up and talk about our own work. 
 I used to bartend and live with Greg, so I know how difficult it can be to run a bar, do marketing, prep for service, and the last thing on his mind was a website.
 Using my knowledge, and of course a prebuilt template, I was able to within a couple hours put together a simple example of my idea for him. 

What I did find difficult was the vastness of the template, assests on top of assests. And since I've never used SASS before, that added an additional level of difficulty.
Luckily I found some work around by simply editing the HTML where I needed to, changing the images' names to change the content, so I didn't work extensively adjusting many of the pre-made styles within the CSS or JS or SASS. 

This will be an on-going project to define exactly what I can do, and what I still need to learn. But Greg is already happy with the result!

Lots of changes to improve the UX design of the site. 

The biggest change was the addition of the buttons at the bottom of each page to aid in navigation.
Before this addition, the user would have to scroll to the top of the screen after each page, close the page, then click the next page for more information.
Now adding the buttons at the bottom of each page creates a beautiful flow from one page to the next, creating a cohesive story. 

Added "The Flights" to showcase an important element of the bar. I used a jpeg image of the menu, it works really well, suprisingly. I might use the same technique for the food menu and whiskey list. But part of me feels it would add a very "cheap" look to the site. 

Fixed the address display on the home screen. As well as added a link to the Instagram page, and below that a "Get Here" button which opens directly to Google Maps location of the bar. 

The biggest issue I'm having is the content itself. The photos Greg provided me are very high quality, but all of them are vertical, leading to difficulties in cropping the image appropariately. The original images of the template used a 3:1 ratio, while Greg's images are all 2:3. I had to make compromises by simply using a 16:9 crop for the images.
